# Support Resources

### Visit the [hapi.dev](https://hapi.dev) Developer Portal for tutorials, documentation, and support.

The portal contains all the resources needed to successfully build hapi-based applications. The content is all free and published under the same BSD license. Feel free to copy and share.

## Community Support

Free support is always available on GitHub. Just open an issue with your question and a community member will try to help. For faster response, join the hapi [Slack channel]( https://join.slack.com/t/hapihour/shared_invite/enQtNTA5MDUzOTAzOTU4LTUyZmFiYjkyMTBmNDcyMmI2MmRjMzg4Y2YzNTlmNzUzNjViN2U1NmYyY2NjYjhiYWU4MGE2OTFhZDRlYWMyZDY) – it’s where many community members hang out and help each other.
Like all open source projects, free support is constrained by the availability of volunteer resources.

## Commercial Support

When free support is not enough, commercial licensing and support plans are available. Please visit the [hapi support page](https://hapi.dev/support/) for more information and pricing.
